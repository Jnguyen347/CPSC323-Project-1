# CPSC 323: Project #1
Hello, and welcome to my repository for CPSC 323 (Compilers): Project #1.

In the Main.cpp file, on this line here:
- **std::fstream inputFile("[INSERT TXT FILE NAME HERE.txt");**

_You may edit/use the following_:
- inputFileTestA.txt (*already included in Main.cpp*)
- inputFileTestB.txt
- inputFileTestC.txt
- Or, add your own .txt file.

_Notes:_
- I wrote the program within the parameters of the most common examples, stated on the two *Project documents* given by the Professor.
- I took each of the C++ examples outlined in those *Project documents* and put them respectively into: *inputFileTestA*, *inputFileTestB*, *inputFileTestC*.
- This is NOT an exhaustive program meant to cover *everything* in the C++ library, nor is it meant to!
- Therefore, by adding your own .txt file, understand that my program may not include ALL test cases and situations.
