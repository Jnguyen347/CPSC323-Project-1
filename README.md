# CPSC 323: Project #1
This is my repository for CPSC 323 (Compilers): Project #1.
This assignment is due: Thursday, October 10th.

In the Main.cpp file located here:
**std::fstream inputFile("[INSERT TXT FILE NAME HERE.txt");**

You may use the following:
- inputFileTestA.txt (*already included in Main.cpp*)
- inputFileTestB.txt
- inputFileTestC.txt
- Or, add your own .txt file.

_Note:_
I wrote the program within the parameters of the most common examples, stated on the *Project examples*.
It is NOT an exhaustive program meant to cover *everything* in the C++ library, nor is it meant to!
Therefore, by adding your own .txt file, my program may not include ALL test cases and situations.
